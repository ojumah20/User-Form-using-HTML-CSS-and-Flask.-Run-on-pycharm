A beginner friendly guide to building a Web App using HTML and CSS that accepts users input and store in a text file using Flask farmework.
To ensure it run properly, store the CSS file in a folder called static, the html file in a folder called template. Then both folders should be stored in  another folder called userform.

Don't forget to run the python file first then use the url generated on the console to launch the web app.
